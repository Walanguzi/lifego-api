This project relies on `node^8.9`, `mongo^3.4` and `postgres^9.4` to run. Make sure they are installed first.

Run the following commands to setup:

  `git clone https://github.com/munala/lifego-api.git`

  `cd lifego-api/`

  `createdb lifego`

  `createdb lifego_test`

  `npm install`

  `npm install -g sequelize sequelize-cli`

  `sequelize db:migrate`

Add the following environment variables to the shell variables:
